   <br>
   <p>Counting our achievements backwards, we organised an amazing flash mob in the month of March 2015. The team of dancers comprised majorly of members of the club. We managed to reach out to a wide and enthusiastic audience through it, in another attempt to keep the flair of art of dancing alive. The event was huge success. The club also contributed by organising band performances in various events organised by other clubs of the college.</p>
   <p>The club conducted recruitment drives for different departments encompassing dance, drama and music. It received an overwhelming response from the enthusiastic students. A team of responsible and dedicated students was thus formed and the club is ever evolving and ever growing to achieve the zenith of perfection.</p>
